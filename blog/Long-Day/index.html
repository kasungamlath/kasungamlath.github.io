<h1><a href="/blog/Long-Day/">Long Day</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2021-08-21</p>
<p>Today I'm having an unusual long day.
Long because I woke up at 5am.
First time after coming to Singapore(3 years ago).
Unusual because I usually wake up after sun made 1/4th of his daily journey.</p>
<p>I wanted to change this late wakeup habit for some time.
But didn't have enough will power I guess.
I set the alarm and go to bed with plans to wake up early.
But the next morning me is not a guy with a plan at all.
And this working from home thing(due to covid restrictions) made is worse.
Because of the flexibility it allowed,
I have no external reason to get up early.</p>
<p>With all this I did wake up early today.
After a ~3 hour sleep at that.</p>
<p>I had an external reason to get up early today.
I(and my friends) had to prepare a morning meal to a temple.
It's common ritual among Buddhists.
We do it for multiple reasons.
This time it's because one of My friend's father died.
Friend I didn't physically meet for 3+ years now.
We believe offering food to monks will give good karma to the departed.</p>
<p>So 2 hours later we(I and my 2 friends) cooked the food and sent it to temple.
It's 7am.
I could have gone back to bed(it's Saturday after all).
My friends did go to bed.</p>
<p>But I didn't.
I wanted to build on this.
I took breakfast, got the bike out and went for a dopamine fix.
My plan was to reward the brain.
So it might help me to wake up early tomorrow.</p>
<p>I did 15km ride in 1 hour and 18 minutes.
It wasn't not that fun,
because the weather was gloomy.</p>
<p>Came home, had a shower.
Did the daily consumption of news.
Read bit from Lord of the Rings(much better than the movie)
And fixed the lunch.
Note that my friends are still asleep.(poor guys missing all the fun)
They got up when I was having lunch.</p>
<p>Then I set to work.
I had 4 sets of unprocessed photos.
I processed them and published(here).
After that I noticed I am yet to do a blog post for this year.
So started writing this,</p>
<p>It's 4.45pm now.
Fingers crossed for tomorrow.</p>

Last weekend I did a hike in Gunung Lambak with a friend.

On Saturday we took the 1440 train from JB and reached Kluang town at 1630.
Our stay was 10min walk from the Railway station.
On Sunday we had an early breakfast at a coffee shop near the hotel.
Then took a taxi to the start of the trail.
Cost of the taxi ride is MYR 6.

My friend is an experienced hiker, and done this hike few times before.
So he's guiding.

Short after the beginning path divided to "normal" and "extreme".

We took the "extreme" trail and reached the summit in about an hour.
At the summit, elevation is 510 m, and ascent is ~422 m.

After a short break we start the descent on the other side.
After reaching to a sub 200 m elevation we started circling the mountain.
Once we reached the "big tree" we started our second ascent.
This was the hardest part of the hike.

When we reached the summit for second time, total ascent of the hike was 821 m.
Total time spent on the hike at this point is 3 hours and 20 mins.

After a short rest we started the descent to the starting point via the "normal" route.
It took us another hour to reach the start point.
From the base we took a taxi to the town.

After putting the stuff back in the hotel, I went out for a snack, and a walk in the town.
Following morning, after the breakfast I packed the bag and went to the shopping mall to wait for the train.

We met at the Railway station at 1200.
Train is scheduled at 1220 and was on time.
We reached JB little earlier than scheduled, at 1400.
After the lunch at JB my friend went to shopping for a hiking boot, and I started the trip back to Singapore.

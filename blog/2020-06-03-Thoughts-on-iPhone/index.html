<p class="meta">Published on 2020-06-03</p>
<p>After the death of my previous Android phone, last month I bought an iphone se 2020.
These are my thoughts after 2 weeks of use.</p>
<p>For the perspective my old phone is a xiaomi mi A2 which I bought for 300 SGD and used for 21 months.
New phone did cost 650 SGD.</p>
<p>It's small, and that's a good thing for me.
It fits perfectly in my pocket.
It's really hard to find a good small android phone these days.
Last time I checked closest thing I found was google pixel4.</p>
<p>Though this model has a bit small battery I get about 2 days of battery life.
About same I got from the old phone.
The earpods it shipped with, sounds good.
I remember hearing some static noise (in varying levels) in all the phone + earphones combos I previously owned.
In this phone + earpods, there isn't any static noise.
Also my bluetooth headset pairs with the phone with no hassle.
(It used to give trouble with my previous phone).
Cellular + wifi Reception is also pretty good.
I used to get disconnected from home wifi in some parts of my room with the old phone.
But new phone doesn't have any such issues.
Also it doesn't heat up while when in call or when charging like old phone did.</p>
<p>When compared the cost of the phone per month, old phone did cost 300SGD/21 = 14.286SGD per month.
So if I'll be able to use this phone for 650SGD / 14.286SGD = 45 months(4 years minus 3 months) new phone is cheaper compared to old phone.
When considering there are still iphone 6 models (released in 6 years ago) which got the latest ios update, I think it's a fairly reasonable expectation.</p>
<p>All in all I'm pretty happy with the new phone.</p>

<p class="meta">Published on 2024-09-19</p>
<p>Last Saturday night I went on a 39km long walk (with few of my friends).
Then on the following night I met a friend of a friend who asked me why I did that.
I couldn’t think of an answer at the moment and said something (I hope) witty.</p>
<p>But later, that got me thinking, why did I do the walk ?
The best answer I could come up with is, because I like walking.
But that didn’t feel like a valid reason.</p>
<p>And then it occurred to me, most of the stuff I do don’t have a “valid” reason.
I just do stuff for the sake of doing them.</p>
<p>Not as means to an end.</p>
<p>And the fact that I don’t know what I want for the most of the time, pairs nicely with this and may be the enabler for this.</p>

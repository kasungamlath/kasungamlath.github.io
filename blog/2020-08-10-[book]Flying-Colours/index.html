<p>This is the story of Hornblower's escape from French prison.
With the support from Mr.Brown, a sailor captured with him and now one leg less Mr. Bush, his first lieutenant.</p>
<p>They make their escape on the way to meet Napoleon (and most possibly their death).
On the way to Napoleon the coach they are carrying get in to accident and after knocking down the French officer who's responsible for them they jumped in to a boat and goes down a river.
But in the middle of the journey they got thrown down in a waterfall.</p>
<p>But a good Frenchman comes in to their aid and provide cover for them until Bush recovers, weather gets better and a boat being built.
In the mean time Hornblower manages to seduce the widowed daughter in law of the Frenchman.</p>
<p>After few months time they successfully ride the boat to sea and captures a British ship caught by French and set sail to England.
Once they got in to England, Hornblower gets to know his wife died on child birth and he's now a father.
In addition Barbara got widowed and she's looking after his son now.
Also Hornblower gets promoted to Commodore.</p>
<p>Hornblower marries Barbara(can't remember it's exactly on this book, but it's definitely before the next book) and all the things workout well for the hero.</p>

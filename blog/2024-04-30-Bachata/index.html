After much deliberation, last February I started going to bachata classes.
So far I completed ~10 classes.
As someone who has no ear for music, it's quite a hard to learn.

In bachata, guys usually lead the dance.
So they need to find the beat and get the ball rolling, so to speak.
Even after 10 classes I still struggle to find the beat, and then to get the count correct.

With no muscle memory to help, I feel my brain working at maximum to coordinate the difference aspects of the dance.
And I feel the brain fuming after about an hour.

I guess this will be much easier with any kind of prior dancing experience, or with a ear for music.
So far it's an interesting, and humbling experience for me.

<p class="meta">Published on 2021-12-31</p>
Today is the final day of 2021.
It's being a quite interesting year, to say the least.
Mostly stuck at home.
Pretty sure I was depressed, at least slightly, in the first part of the year.

Apart from that, in year 2021 I,

* Shot, processed and published 32 sets of [photos](/photos).
* Wrote (whole lot of) 1 blog post.
* Bought a GoPro, with plans to building a documentary of my day-to-day life.
* Build a gaming PC, which was a childhood dream and will facilitate editing videos/photos.
* Set up a home theater with a projector+roku stick and a media server.
* Bought a Garmin Fenix 6, to help my running training.
* Run 687km this year.

So again, It's being an interesting year.

<p class="meta">Published on 2015-06-18</p>
<p>After 2 months since public release Train Buddy now have more than 100 total installs. I know it's not much. But it's just another app (yet), to view train schedule in Srilanka with a updated UI. So thank you, each and every one who installed the train buddy.</p>
<p>Train Buddy never went viral. Always just few installs per day. But the growth was steady. The most used app in this category has around 100,000 installations. But it's released by ICTA and kind of the &quot;official&quot; app. 2nd most popular app has about 10,000 intallations. So the good new is only 16 more years to catchup with that in this rate of installations.</p>

<p>But the most important thing is now the app has completed the goal for it's 2nd iteration. Which will enable viewing the status of trains when you are &quot;not on board&quot;. With the vacation coming up in next month, I think this could be completed before the end of this July (if my research work allows me, fingers crossed). As usual beta testers will get the new version first.

January was all rain.
That means no cycling, no Tennis, only an occasional run.

Office work is also in a challenging mode.
Because, for the Neuromorphic project we recently started, I needed to learn low level details on deep learning.

But my gym frequency is good so far.
I've made a New-Year resolution to go to gym at 9am, 4 days per week.
After a rough start, that habit is settiling in now.
Last week I started doing Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 BB program properly.

I did,
* bench press - 30 x 5, 35 x 5, 40 x 5, 30 x 10 x 5
* back squat - 45 x 5, 50 x 5, 55 x 5, 40 x 10 x 5
* dead lift - 60 x 5, 70 x 5, 85 x 5, 50 x 10 x 5
* overhead press - 20 x 5, 25 x 5, 30 x 5, 20 x 10 x 5

For whatever reason squats hit me the hardest and I had trouble climbing stairs even after 2 days of work out.

There were 2 BBQ nights back to back on last 2 saturdays.
Come to think of it, one in East (of singapore) and other in West.

I also did my friend's post-wedding shoot last week.
Photos turned out to be quite OK considering I had to use the sony a6000 with kit lens.

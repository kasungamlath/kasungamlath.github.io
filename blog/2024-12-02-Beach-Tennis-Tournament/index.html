<p>I Joined my first Beach Tennis Tournament this November.
And played in the mixed double category.</p>
<p>We won 1 out of 4 games.
And we almost lost the game we won.
We were down to 0-4 at one point.
The final score for winning game is 7-5.</p>
<p>For the rest it's 0-6, 1-6 and, 4-6.</p>
<p>I was quite stressed during the tournament.
And found hitting the ball harder than I usually do, causing it to go either long or wide.
The game felt way harder and tiring than when I play for fun.</p>
<p>Now I have a IFBT ranking. 2 to be precise. Though I've no idea why there are 2 rankings.</p>

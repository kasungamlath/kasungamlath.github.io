<p>I'm planning to run my 3rd half marathon this December.
This is the third time and it's a &quot;real&quot;/in-person race.
Last two times were virtual because of COVID restrictions.
This is my second in-person race and I'm quite excited.</p>
<p>Since both of previous half marathons took almost 3 hours,
This time I thought of following a structured training to improve the timing.
I signed up for Garmin Coach half marathon training program with a two hour time goal.
It's a 15 week program with 4 days training per week.
Now I'm on the 5th week.
At the moment Garmin Coach it pretty confidence that I can meet the time goal.</p>

<p>But there's a planned upset in my training.
I'll be away from running for a month due to my travelling.
So I'm not quite sure how it'll impact my training.
If it impacts it'll be in a bad way.
Nevertheless I'm following the plan and going to run on this December.
Hopefully meeting the time goal.</p>
<p>BTW I paused my GYM program until the race to make time for running.</p>

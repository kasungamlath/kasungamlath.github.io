<p>Third time is a charm.
After two failed attempts,
today I managed to complete the round island cycle ride.
Granted I lost the track few times and ended up in highways 2 times,
I finished 120km ride in 9:30 hours.
And did it solo.</p>
<p>I started around 10pm on Dec29th.
I dined at Macdonalds in ECP around 1am(Hawker center was closed)
Caught in a little drizzle around 4am
Otherwise whether was perfect.
Then had morning tea at Kranji at 5.30 am.
Last 20km was the hardest.
The traffic was also dense after 6am.
Finished before 8am on Den 30th.</p>

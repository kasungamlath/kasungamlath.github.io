This is my second visit to Sigiriya.
I believe the first visit is more than 20 years ago.

We reached there in early evening.
It's about 500 m walk to the base of the rock from the car park.
The facilities in Sigiriya are well-kept, and seems to be well managed.

I forgot to bring the SD card for the camera.
I bought a new mini SD card on the way, but found out it got an issue with the adapter.
Thus I was forced to use the phone camera.

From the base of the rock it's only a short climb, though quite difficult.
And it's very windy, specially at the top, and on some parts of the route.
I think it took about 40 minutes to climb to the top from the base.
It's mainly stairs and one person lane.

At the top it's still possible to see the structure of the old palace.

Halfway on the way back there's a separate path to see the frescoes.
There are few frescoes in good condition and colors are still vibrant.
Unfortunately they prohibited taking pictures of the frescoes citing damages to the painting.

We came down on a different route and noticed, close to the bottom there are still a few parts of old kingdom.
They are preserved mainly because it's carved to the rock itself.

We returned the car park around 6pm.

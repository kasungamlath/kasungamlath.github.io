<p>This book is mainly about football.
In Ankh-Morpork, football is a wild game played on streets with violence.
Vetinary(ruler of Anch-Morpork) wants to tame football.
So he organizes a football tournament and ask the archchancellor of Unseen University(University of wizards) to participate in it.
Wizards make a team with librarian(happens to be a ape due to magic spell gone wrong) as the goal keeper.
And eventually Mister Nutt get to be the coach plus substitute of the team.</p>
<p>Mister Nutt happens to be a orc.
General opinion is orcs are bad.
They tear off limbs of living humans.
Orcs are now thought to be extinct.
But Mister Nutt is well read nice orc, whom the extinction is yet to happen.
And his main job is to dribble candles at the Unseen University.</p>
<p>But the mobs who were the main part of the old football are trying to bring violence to new football.</p>

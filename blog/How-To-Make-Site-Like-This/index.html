<p>After using Jekyll for some time(about 4 years) and writing occasional posts recently I decided to try something new.
The situation with static site generators seems to be improved a lot since I first tried it. Static sites popularity has being risen and there are lots of site generators with lots of bells and whistles too. But this time I decided to go with a simplest site generator I could find.</p>
<p>I found one which was written in python. It's named <a href="https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite">makesite</a> and has about 1.2k stars on Github.
I forked the repo and made few changes. Mainly to support the Photo post layouts.(I picked up photography as a serious hobby few months ago)
It does what i need and nothing more. And more importantly I know exactly what goes under when come to generating it. So it's totally customizable to my needs if they change in the future.</p>
<p>Now I have my personal space with a simpler design.</p>

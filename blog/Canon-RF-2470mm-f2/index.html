<p>This week I bought my 2nd lens of the holy trinity.
24-70mm f2.8.
I already had the 70-200mm f2.8 lens.</p>
<p>I was looking for a clear sky to take some nature pics.
Which still not arrived.
But I did some experiments with product photography.</p>

<p>Something I read while back keep popping in to the mind.
“Fearing the fear.”
This week I “discovered” Singapore National Library Building at Bugis.
And It’s real nice to place to do focused work.</p>
<p>I also noted I skipped writing blog posts for past 2 weeks.
(Right after the self proclamation to write a post once every week)
Well it’s better late than never.
I’ll be posting 2 back dated posts along with this post.</p>

<p>As I have being running more frequently now I felt a need to log those runs.
So I could see the progress.
My plan was to record the acceleration through out the running session and since it enables to see speed variations.
But to record the acceleration I need to carry a accelerometer on the run.
I'm hesitant to carry a mobile phone because it felts a hindrance to running.</p>
<p>I burrowed a MiBand3 from a friend and gave it a try last weekend.
Problem was via the official app it only outputs the step count.
Band uses the accelerometer data and produces the step count.
I found a <a href="https://medium.com/machine-learning-world/how-i-hacked-xiaomi-miband-2-to-control-it-from-linux-a5bd2f36d3ad">blog post</a> (with the link to source code) about the getting the raw accelerometer data(real time) from a MiBand2.
I setup the project and following another <a href="https://medium.com/@yogeshojha/i-hacked-xiaomi-miband-3-and-here-is-how-i-did-it-43d68c272391">blog post</a> changed the authentication steps and managed to connect to MiBand3 from a rapberry pi.
But unfortunately the mentioned raw accelerometer data retrieval part didn't work for the MiBand3.
I could only get the step count and the heart rate from the band to raspberry pi.</p>
<p>I looked for some other bands on the internet with the access to raw accelerometer data but couldn't find any.
It seems in order to get a wearable device which produces the raw data I'll have to buy a at least midrange smart watch.</p>
<p>Or find a way to change the firmware of miband to store+return raw accelerometer data...</p>

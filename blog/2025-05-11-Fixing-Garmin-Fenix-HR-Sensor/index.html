I bought a Garmin Fenix 6 on 2021 November.
Around 2023 April, HR sensor stopped working.
I assumed it's a software issue, and tried various fixes including 1) soft/hard resetting. 2) upgrading/downgrading firmware & software.
But nothing fixed it.
At the end I settled to buy a Garmin HR chest strap on 2024 June.
This setup worked well for workouts, but strap is not comfortable to wear all the time, so I'd still miss on the always on heart rate sensor.

When I was researching the issue while most of the resources suggested this is a software issue, there were few saying this could be a loose cable.
But I was hesitant to take the watch apart and didn't pay much attention to this possibility, until this week.

Last week was the final week of my busiest school term so far (both as a student and instructor).
Once the final grading frenzy was over (with much vigor) I started working on all the fun stuff I wanted to do but didn't have a time to.
This included 1) buying a drone 2) buying a mini PC (to set up as a home server).
When I was doing all this shopping, at some point I found myself comparing the Apple Watch Ultra and Watch 10. (By this time I'm convinced the issue is a software issue and didn't want to invest in Garmin products anymore)
Then it occurred to me if I'm to buy a new watch, why not try and re-seat the cable.

So yesterday I turned the watch off and took it apart.
I removed the backplate first, but the cable was not accessible from the back.
I put the backplate back, turned on the watch to check the watch is still working.
Turning the watch off again, removed the front panel.
Removed both cables visible, cleaned them using an alcohol solution and reseated them.

Then re-screwed the front panel back, and turned the watch back on.
And I believe this is the happiest I've being after seeing a blinking green light (HR sensor blink green when trying to find the wrist).
Just like that, after two years of a comma HR sensor is up and working again.

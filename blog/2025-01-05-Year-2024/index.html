<p class="meta">Published on 2025-01-05</p>
There wasn't any big changes in Year 2024.
It's more like a continuation of 2023.
Thinking back, highlights of this year would be:
* [Joining a Bachata class](/blog/2024-04-30-Bachata/) (And finding out I'm quite bad at dancing)
* [Doing 69 km walk over ~17 hours](/blog/2024-07-08-Walk-in-the-Park(s))
* [Taking ~17 hours Train ride](/blog/2024-07-17-Kota-Bharu)
* [Joining a Beach Tennis tournament for the first time](blog/2024-12-02-Beach-Tennis-Tournament)\
_I'm the top ranked (and apparently only) Beach Tennis player in Sri Lanka._

I did also signup for a marathon.
But got sick right before the marathon and wasn't able to run.

Following are the goals I set for 2024 and final state of them. 
- ✅ Go to 5 volunteer events - _Did 8 events as a photographer, totaling 45.25 hours_ 
- ✅ Read 30 books (20/30) - _49 books (Including 15 Diary of Wimpy Kid books)_
- ✅ Start dance course - _Completed 6 month course_
- ❌ Travel to 1 new countries - _Though I did travel overseas multiple of times, I didn't travel to any new country_
- ❌ Make an electronic photo magazine - _No excuse_
- ❌ Run a full marathon under 5 hours - _Got sick_

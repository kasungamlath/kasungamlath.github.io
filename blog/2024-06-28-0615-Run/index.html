Last month I signed up for Singapore Marathon.
Then I bought a heart-rate strap.
Searched for a marathon training program and found one.
But couldn't find a time to run.
My evenings have found a way to be occupied someway or other.
So thought of doing a morning run.

By now I'm quite familiar about the problem of different person waking up than the one went asleep.
So me and my flatmate, (he's also into running) we came to an agreement.
If either of us didn't show up at 0615 all set to run, will have to buy wok-hey for the other.

And it worked.
Today we did a morning run.
And ran for about 3 km.
I felt quite out of breath during the run.
Either I'm out of shape or I didn't find the rhythm today.

The weather was nice today though.
And got to a great start for the day.

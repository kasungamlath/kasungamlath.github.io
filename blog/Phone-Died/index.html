<p>My phone is a Xiaomi mi A2.
I Specially bought this model because I was in love with google those days and this model was a android one phone.
It guaranteed 2 years of software updates(from google at that time).
So at the cost of 300SGD it was a no brainer.
I bought it on 2018 August after the death of previous phone.</p>
<p>It's display got cracked around 2018 November when I had a running accident.
Never got around to replace the screen.</p>
<p>Day before yesterday(2020 May 18) it stopped charging.
It was having troubles with charging for some time.
When I plugged it in to fast charging it charged slowly.
while getting unusualy heated.
That might be the reason for death.
Interesting thing is it started having these issues after April security update.
Internet is saying that my phone isn't alone in this case.
Lots of people having charging issues after that security update.
Since xiaomi is responsible for those updates(Not google as promised early) they might be to be blamed.</p>
<p>Now it lays in my camera drybox awaiting a chance at revival.</p>

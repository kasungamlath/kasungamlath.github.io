Today I made fried rice from left over rice and chicken.
The taste of this varient is more similar to fried rice found in small shops.

The final result look like this,

![full-width](/assets/fried_rice.jpg)

Ingredients :
* Left over rice collected over about a week and stored in fridge,
(storing in the fridge adds a nice texture to the rice)
* 2 Carrots - cut in to thin pieces.
* 3 Leaks - cut in to small pieces.(doesn't add much taste, but looks great)
* 3 Red onions - cut in to small pieces.
* 3 garlic pieces - same as red onions but smaller.
* small piece of ginger - chopped in to small pieces.
* 4 eggs
* left over bite chicken - microwave and peel in to thin pieces.
* piece of butter.
* Salt and pepper.

Process:
* Once ingredients are prepared,
Heat the wok.
* Add butter and let it melt.
* Add garlic.
* Heat until garlic become kind of golden brown.
* Add red onion.
* When onions changed the color to golden brown add carrot.
* Add salt and pepper to the taste.
* Heat until carrot is half cooked.
* Make space in the middle of the wok and put the contents of eggs there.
* Mix the stuff in the wok well.
* Heat it until the eggs become tiny solid pieces.
* Add chicken pieces and leaks to the mix at this point. 
* Mix it well.
* Add rice.
* increase the heat.
* Keep mixing it until you hear noise of kind of tiny explosions of the rice.

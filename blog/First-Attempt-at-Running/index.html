<p class="meta">Published on 2020-06-18</p>
<p>First time I remember running for exercise is when I was in university.
I was either in 3rd or 4th year.
This is either 2014 or 2015, Because I graduated in early 2016.</p>
<p>Got up early morning one day and went for a run.
The reason I remember this event is because of a dog.
With Adjectives like big and vicious looking.</p>
<p>I started the run around 4 am.
I have to get ready and leave for university later that day.
I usually get the 6.13 office train to go to university.
It's about a two hour journey to the university from my home.
Just in time for the morning lecture.</p>
<p>So back to running.
I was going in a steady pace and just passing the 3rd bus halt.
Suddenly I heard a low growl.</p>
<p>When a dog is interested in you in a bad way, first thing to do is stop.
If you run it will definitely chase you.
And dogs can run pretty fast too.</p>
<p>So I stopped.
There was a huge, vicious looking dog snarling at me.
Standing in front of a closed shop.
Most probably it's home.</p>
<p>I tried moving away a bit, slowly.
Growling increased.
I stopped.</p>
<p>There was nobody in the vicinity either.
It was still around 4.30 I think.
World is still sound asleep.
And I was stuck with staring match with a dog.</p>
<p>This went around for about 30 minutes.
Around 5am the road became gradually alive and dog lost the interest me.
Only then I was able to walk away.</p>
<p>And I lost the interest in running for a long time.</p>

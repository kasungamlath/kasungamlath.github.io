<h1><a href="/blog/Rationale-Behind-Brightness-Module/">Rationale Behind Brightness Module</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2020-05-29</p>
<p>The research project I'm working on these days is suppose to make a building smart.
It should know it's occupants whereabouts and have to adjust energy related parameters(light level, AC level, etc) accordingly.
For example if there are 3 people occupying a 1 desk in a big room with 25 desks, it should keep lights in workable level only around the occupied desk.
The ultimate goal is reducing the energy consumption while keeping occupants happy.</p>
<p>In order to optimally adjust the lights building should also have a sense of the brightness of the affecting area.
Else there a chance to wrongfully adjust the lights and be a dumb building.</p>
<p>We already have a dockerized system to detect the occupancy of the building.
And we have promising results for the brightness detection too(fingers crossed).
So I am designing a new docker service to integrate this brightness detection to that existing system.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the module are,</p>
<ol>
<li>access each cameras feed</li>
<li>detect the brightness of each scene</li>
<li>write that values to a database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then another service will read this brightness value and the occupancy values(output of another module) and adjust the buildings AC and lights.</p>
<p>To do this first we have to access the camera feed.
There are about 50 cameras in the building.
We are using opencv library VidoeCapture method for that.
Since it's a blocking call and a expensive at that, module will have one thread to decode each camera feed.
Then since detection of brightness is also comparatively a expensive operation there will be one brightness calculating thread for each camera.
All this calculated brightness values will go for a single queue and a single database thread will write all these values to DB.</p>
<p>That's the design at the start and based on metrics it will be adjusted.
After all <em>premature optimization is the root of all evil</em>.</p>

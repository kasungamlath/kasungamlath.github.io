<p class="meta">Published on 2022-12-04</p>
<p>There were thunderstorms at 4.30am.
Time the race supposed to start.
Race was delayed until 5.30am.
20,000 people waited for an hour in the rain anxious to start running.</p>

<p>Running in-person race feels physically hard but mentally easy.
Physically hard because you're surrounded by other runners,
had to run around them some times and try to avoid tripping.
Mentally easy because again you're surrounded by other runners.
And there were people cheering.
Cheering with funny slogans.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;You could've played chess&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I'm sure it seemed a good idea 4 months ago&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end it's a great experience,
even though it's a dripping start.
According to my 1 year old Garmin data I made 4 personal records in today's race.</p>
<ol>
<li>Fasted 5k - 27:56</li>
<li>Fastest 10k - 59:37</li>
<li>Fastest half marathon - 2:14:04</li>
<li>Longest run - 21.93km</li>
</ol>
<p>But again Garmin map was a mess, because the route was through the high rise buildings.
According to SCSM numbers, my Net time was 02:21:11 with 02:33:48 gun time.
So the official timing for the half marathon in 02:21:11.
30 minutes less than last year.
6+ minutes bellow my target.
But given the bad start it's a good time IMO.
Thank you Garmin coach.</p>

<p>Hardest part of the route was the arc shaped bridge around 18km mark.
Running through the climb made me breathless.
And it took sometime to recover back.
But I managed to make my last leg the fastest.</p>

<p>Until next year.</p>

Yesterday I stopped running for few months.
This is me bragging about my running on 2020.

I started this running season somewhere on April.
Mostly because there isn't anything else to do (stuck at home due to covid restrictions).

Around May I came across the book "Running Formula" by "Jack Daniels" and started practicing + tracking runs.
By the June [I did 5k](https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Stats-for-Half-Month-of-Running/).
I stopped the practicing by the book once I made it to a certain level.
(There were bunch of ranking levels in the book)

And started running for just fun.

Then came the virtual runs.
Idea of virtual run is you sign up for a certain distance to do within a certain time period.

I did few of them.

* [SMU SwimRunSprint](https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Virtual-Marathon/)(no swimming this year)

* Straits Times virtual run 175km

Longest run I did is a [half marathon](https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Half-Marathon/)(which took almost 3 hours).
With a pretty bad pace.

Now it's time for go back to book again and improve the pace(after few months rest)

<p>Yesterday I stopped running for few months.
This is me bragging about my running on 2020.</p>
<p>I started this running season somewhere on April.
Mostly because there isn't anything else to do (stuck at home due to covid restrictions).</p>
<p>Around May I came across the book &quot;Running Formula&quot; by &quot;Jack Daniels&quot; and started practicing + tracking runs.
By the June <a href="https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Stats-for-Half-Month-of-Running/">I did 5k</a>.
I stopped the practicing by the book once I made it to a certain level.
(There were bunch of ranking levels in the book)</p>
<p>And started running for just fun.</p>
<p>Then came the virtual runs.
Idea of virtual run is you sign up for a certain distance to do within a certain time period.</p>
<p>I did few of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Virtual-Marathon/">SMU SwimRunSprint</a>(no swimming this year)

</ul>
<p>Longest run I did is a <a href="https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Half-Marathon/">half marathon</a>(which took almost 3 hours).
With a pretty bad pace.</p>
<p>Now it's time for go back to book again and improve the pace(after few months rest)</p>

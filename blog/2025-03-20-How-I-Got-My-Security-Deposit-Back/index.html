<p class="meta">Published on 2025-03-20</p>
<p>I had trouble getting the security deposit back from my previous landlord. (He doesn't own the property, act as the main tenant)</p>
<p>When I requested the security deposit (SGD 1450) at end of the tenancy period, I got a reply that it’s denied because of some (alleged) damages I caused.
Though I was expecting this kind of response (given the experiences of other tenants) it still came as a shock, and I replied I’ll file a case (in SCT) unless they return my deposit back.
Right after this, they made a claim against me requesting SGD 3510 (minus deposit) in SCT.
Their breakdown as follows,</p>
<ul>
<li>Repair of scratched floor - $900</li>
<li>Repair of cupboard scuffs - $200</li>
<li>Changing and Repair of Broken Door - $400</li>
<li>Changing and Fixing of Broken Power Outlet - $200</li>
<li>1 Month Loss of Rental Income - $1,450</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m still not sure why they went ahead and filed the case first.
Because as I see it, there’s no way their claims hold in a court (or any reasonable person buying it for that matter).
Maybe they were trying to intimidate me with a court order.
Or maybe they were trying to play victim and get the court to favor them by filing the case first.
It's also possible they were just trying to delay the payment, since the claimant get to pick the first consultation date.</p>
<p>The SCT work like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Claimant files a claim (with a defects schedule) and pick the fist consultation date.
(And they have to serve the court notice to respondent within seven days.)</li>
<li>Respondent reply to the defects schedule, prior to the first consultation.</li>
<li>At the first consultation (physical or online), claimant and respondent meet in front of the court registrar.
Registrar explains process of the court and hear from both parties.</li>
<li>Depending on the situation registrar recommends another consultation, mediation or trial.</li>
<li>If the suggestion is another consultation or mediation, both parties have to agree, else the case directly to a trial.</li>
</ol>
<p>First consultation was set on Dec 30th.
Three months after I moved out, and two months after I requested the deposit.
(This is why I assumed they were trying to delay the payment)</p>
<p>While waiting for the consultation, I talked with few friends and colleagues, and looked up on the court process.
I also replied to the defect schedule they file in the SCT.
I already had photos of the floor at the beginning of the tenancy period, and I said other defects are hardly noticeable and at any case should be considered as normal wear and tear except for the power plug.
The power plug I replied, is working when I moved out. (as I found out later, it's still working. The new tenant didn't check it properly)
For the loss of rental income I replied, since I’m not responsible for any of the damages I’m not liable.</p>
<p>The first consultation date arrived, and I was quite nervous about it.
During the consultation registrar asked where we stand.
Claimant went first, and listed the damages I allegedly did.
When my turn came, I repeated what I submitted as reply to defect schedule, and evidence he provided doesn’t claim otherwise.
To this the other party replied they have more evidence.
After hearing this and checking the current state of evidences, registrar gave a deadline to other party to upload all the evidence, and set another consultation on 27th Jan.
This first consultation session started about 30 min late, and lasted for about an hour.</p>
<p>Second consultation was postponed to 3rd February.
(later I found out this is due to another court case regarding the security deposit with this landlord and another tenant)
Claimant didn’t manage to upload any new evidence, and during the consultation said they are ready to settle for 600 (150 SGD per each four defects).
By then it's clear to me, this is a fishing expedition from the claimant to retain (at least) part of the deposit or just to delay the payment.
I stood my ground and refused this offer.
I said I’ll only settle for the full deposit.</p>
<p>Other party requested one more day to consider this.</p>
<p>So a third consultation was arranged on following day, Feb 4th.</p>
<p>During this session, other party said they are willing to settle and agreed to return the full deposit within a month.
I said I’m okay with this arrangement and the court issued an order stating this final agreement.</p>
<p>On March 3rd (five months after moving out) I was paid the full deposit back.</p>
<p>Looking back it was quite a lot of work and mental energy spent to get what’s rightfully mine.
And the monetary value of the deposit wasn’t enough to cover this effort.</p>
<p>But I learned a lot from this experience, and I believe the things I learned, is worth the effort and getting the deposit back is only the icing of the cake.</p>

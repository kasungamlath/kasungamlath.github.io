It all started with an article on Straight Times Singapore.
The Story is about group of people walking from Raffles Marina lighthouse in Singapore to Inscription of island in Changi.
Total distance was 60+ km.
I asked few of my friend from SMU if they are interested to do such walk.
Eight of them were.

We planned to do the walk on 6th of July 2024.
Meet up point is Tuas-Link MRT at 8pm.
I drew the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1t72893BO0iOoIDPzb3DhYpAIa7SEuyQ&usp=sharing" target="_blank">route for the walk</a> and shared with the group.

On the walk day, I got a sore throat.
Did a covid test which reported negative.
To be hones I think I'll be happier if it came positive.
Because I'm not feeling very well.
But since I'm the organizer of the walk, I need a good excuse if I'm to skip the walk.
And just "not feeling well" isn't going to cut it.

We met at Tuas Link MRT as planned.

There were six of us at the beginning.
Three of the original party didn't show up, but we got a new member.

We walked up to the Raffles Marina lighthouse to start the walk.

First leg of the walk is through the Tuas area.
The industrial area of Singapore.
Roads were wide and deserted at the early night.
First stretch is from Raffles Marina lighthouse to Ulu Pandan reservoir.

One of the group dropped from the walk after first stretch.
We restocked our water and went for a nearby food stall for a tea.

After the tea went to a Fair price to buy some snacks.
Two more of our group dropped from the walk, and opted to cycle to home after the Fair Price.

Second leg of the walk is through the PCN to Buono Vista.
We were three to begin the second leg.
PCN is almost deserted, but it's much better walking experience compared to the first leg.
When we reached Bonavista we've walked total of 25km.

At Bonavista, remaining two members also decided to end the walk.
And I started the third leg of the walk to ECP alone.
This part is also quite similar to the second leg.
It's all through the PCN up until ECP.

When I reached the Robertson Quay it's early morning of Sunday.

From Robertson Quay to Clarke Quay there were few people trying to postpone a hangover.
And there were lighted up bridges.

Flier looked beautiful from the bridge crossing Singapore river.

At the beginning of ECP it's still dark.
![](/assets/blog/walk/ecp-start.jpg)
But by the time I reach the Food Village there was some light.
And few shops were open including my favorite Popiah place.
For the breakfast I had two Popiah and a tea (which was too sweet).

Then I started the fourth leg of my walk from ECP to Changi Loop.
By then it's a bright morning painted with a light drizzle.
Lots of people taking their weekly outdoor dose at the park.
![](/assets/blog/walk/ecp.jpg)
I feel out of the whole route this part is the most pleasant.

At the beginning of Changi loop there was a choice.
Either to continue via Changi loop or cut through the city to Changi beach.
And I chose to go via Changi loop.
Which I regretted around 1/3 in to the loop.
There were no people, and it's literary a desert (with trees).
![](/assets/blog/walk/changi-loop.jpg)
Whole loop was about 20km.
And I had to do it alone.
There wasn't even place to sit.

It's quite hard to explain how I felt during that part.
I think it's like person stuck on a lonely island who's forced to walk.
I tried singing aloud but had a hard time remembering any lyrics.
So I focused on completing the walk as fast as possible, and tried to keep the pace at 10min/km (mine usual is ~11min/km).
It was a good distraction.

At the end of Changi loop is Changi park connector.

And there was water refiling station near the "Changi tree".

Sun was up by now, and I was exhausted.
Only the idea of finishing the walk kept me going at this point.

Right after the Changi tree it's Changi point.

Once I reached the Changi Beach Park I was almost crawling.
I went to the Inscription and took a photo to mark the end.
![](/assets/blog/walk/inscription.jpg)
My watch said I walked total of 69.76 km in total of 16 hours and 51 minutes.
![](/assets/blog/walk/finish-watch.jpg)
I spent about 15 min there in the park resting the legs, and went to Changi Village hawker center to get lunch.

Then took a long hard ride to a hot bath.

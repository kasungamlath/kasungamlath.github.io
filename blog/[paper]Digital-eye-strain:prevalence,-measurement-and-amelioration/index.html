<p>Digital Eye Stain (DES) have estimated prevalence of 50% or more among Computer Users.
Symptoms fall in to 2 categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>due to accommodative or binocular vision stress</li>
<li>due to dry eye</li>
</ol>
<p>Symptoms are typical transient.</p>
<p>There are several available questionnaires to identify and measure DES.
It also can be measured and identify by using objective evaluations of bellow parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>critical flicker-fusion frequency.</li>
<li>blink rate and completeness.</li>
<li>accommodative function and pupil characteristics</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the correlation between objective and subjective measures are not apparent.</p>
<p>Range of management approaches available for DES</p>
<ul>
<li>correction of refractive error and/or presbyopia</li>
<li>management of dry eye</li>
<li>incorporating regular screen breaks</li>
<li>consideration of vergence and accommodative problems</li>
</ul>
<p>DES and visual fatigue(VF) is used for Computer Vision Syndrom(CVS).</p>
<p>In 2016 UK adults typically spend 4hours 45mins per day staring at screens.
USA it's about 5 or more hours</p>
<p>Most common symptoms associated with DES are,</p>
<ul>
<li>eyestrain (asthenopia)</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>blurred vission</li>
<li>dry eyes</li>
<li>pain in the neck and shoulders</li>
</ul>
<p>DES is very common problem
2016 Digital Eye Stain report with 10,000 US adults</p>
<ul>
<li>65% total</li>
<li>69% of female</li>
<li>60% of male</li>
<li>73% who uses 2 or more devices simultaneously</li>
<li>53% single device</li>
</ul>
<p>When computer use is 6 or more hours,
contact wearers are more likely to affected(65% vs 50%)</p>
<p>Widely dissimilar diagnostic criteria for DED means the overall figures have a limited value.
There are recent detailed recommendation for diagnostic methodology</p>
<ul>
<li>first symptom screening with ocular surface disease index or dry eye questionnaire(DEQ-5) instruments</li>
<li>then objective clinical tests in in DED suspects</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measuring DES</h2>
<h3>subjective</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 item questionnaire created by Hayes</li>
<li>six item visual fatigue scale</li>
<li>Rasch based computer vision symptom scale</li>
<li>validated questionnaire in english to evaluate DES in workspace</li>
<li>self administered computer vision syndrome questionnaire</li>
</ul>
<h3>objective</h3>
<ul>
<li>critical flicker fusion frequency
<ul>
<li>the frequency which a flickering light is indistinguishable from a steady non-flickering light. reduced activity of the retina and/or optic nerve can cause this frequency number to decrease</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Blinking characteristics
<ul>
<li>blinking helps to maintain normal ocular surface. before computer use mean - 18.4, during computer use - 3.6. incomplete blinks can also cause the dry eyes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Accommodative effects
<ul>
<li>pre-prebyopes must be able to accommodate rapidly+smoothly and maintain a accurate response to perform near tasks comfortably. But when viewing computer displays this accomadation shows a lag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pupillary light relex and size
<ul>
<li>increase of pupil size indicates visual fatigue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mangement of Dry Eye</h2>
<p>use of lubricating eye drops reduce tiredness dryness and difficulty focusing.
dietary supplementaion with omega-3 fatty acids
blink training may help, (Increasing blink rate through use of an audible prompt signal every 4s during a computer task was not found to alter  symptom  score)
blink efficiency exercise to address incomplete blinks may helpfull
fix issures related to refractive error and fresbyopia - spectacles for screen use
fix accommodation and vergence anomalies - frequent short breaks,
blue light - exposure to blue light (400-500nm) can be harmful to the retina. melatonin involved in physiological ctrl of sleep. it's controlled by photosensitive retinal ganflion cells containing melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity of approximately 482nm.</p>
<h2>conclusion</h2>
<p>usage is digital devices is norm today.
this leads to DES.
it's important eye care practitioners are well informed about this.
DES symtoms are linked to
1. external - dry eye
2. internal - related to ameropia, accommodation or vergence problems.
questionaires are valueble in evluating DES.</p>

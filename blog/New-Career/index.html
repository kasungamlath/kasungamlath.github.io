<h1><a href="/blog/New-Career/">New Career</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2023-08-24</p>
<p>This is the second week of my 3rd career.
After graduating, in 2016 February I started my career as a software engineer.
In 2018 Aug I started working as a research engineer.
After 5 years now in 2023 Aug I am a teacher. Instructor to be exact.</p>
<p>I feel research engineer to instructor transition is more drastic than the transition from software engineer to research engineer.
Now I have to keep regular office hours (at least on the days I’m teaching).
Also once the week finishes work for that week is also finishes, unlike in engineering where tasks get carried over for long time and never really finishes.</p>
<p>This term I’m supporting four sections of a first year course.
Three sections from 0815-1115, and one from 1530-1830 which spans over three days.</p>
<p>This forces me to wake up early.
And I figured out waking up early everyday is much easier than waking up early only on some of the days.
(Finally I’m working on my new year resolution).</p>

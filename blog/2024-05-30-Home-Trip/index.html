<p class="meta">Published on 2024-05-30</p>
I was home for almost two weeks now.
I came here on 17th this month and will be going back this Sunday.
Up to now it rained every day to varying degrees.

Traveling in Sri Lanka on public transport in not an easy job.
It's crowded and unpredictable.
When it rains the difficulty to travel multiplies.

So most of these two weeks were spent at home.
I had to scrap few plans to meet friends.
It's very hard to leave a cozy home when raining outside and road is muddy.

But I managed to make few trips and shoot some photos even it rained,
* [Kurunegala](https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Lake-Round-Kurunegala-On-A-Rainy-Day/)
* [Wattarama](https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Well-of-Death/)

Few backyard photo session,
* [Session 1](https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Chili,-Flower,-and-a-Dog/)
* [Session 2](https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Back-Yard-Nature-Photography/)

Add few books to my book list,
* Valley of the Dolls _by Jacqueline Susann_
* The Outsider _by Stephen King_

And watch numerous movies !!!

At the end it became a very relaxing (and kind of boring) vacation at home.

<p class="meta">Published on 2024-05-30</p>
<p>I was home for almost two weeks now.
I came here on 17th this month and will be going back this Sunday.
Up to now it rained every day to varying degrees.</p>
<p>Traveling in Sri Lanka on public transport in not an easy job.
It's crowded and unpredictable.
When it rains the difficulty to travel multiplies.</p>
<p>So most of these two weeks were spent at home.
I had to scrap few plans to meet friends.
It's very hard to leave a cozy home when raining outside and road is muddy.</p>
<p>But I managed to make few trips and shoot some photos even it rained,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Lake-Round-Kurunegala-On-A-Rainy-Day/">Kurunegala</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Well-of-Death/">Wattarama</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Few backyard photo session,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Chili,-Flower,-and-a-Dog/">Session 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kasungamlath.com/photos/Back-Yard-Nature-Photography/">Session 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Add few books to my book list,</p>
<ul>
<li>Valley of the Dolls <em>by Jacqueline Susann</em></li>
<li>The Outsider <em>by Stephen King</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And watch numerous movies !!!</p>
<p>At the end it became a very relaxing (and kind of boring) vacation at home.</p>

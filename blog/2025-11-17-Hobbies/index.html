<p>Reading
I loved reading since I was a kid. I was a regular in my neighbourhood library. And I remember asking for books when I passed my scholary exam at grade 5. I used to read with passion. I'd often read a book at one go. I remember my mother urging me to go out and play instead of reading, because I was reading the whole day. I believe I read until I go to high school. Then someway or other this habit stopped until I started my first job and bought a kindle. Having the kindle opened up to a unlimited source of books. Somewhere around 2020 I started maintaining a list of books I read and according to it I read 20-30 books per year.</p>
<p>Playing Cricket
This was another of my childhood hobbies. In 1996 Srilanka won the cricket world cup and suddenly everybody is playing cricket. We're four regulars (sometimes other kids also joined). I think we played almost everyday. There's a clear space infront of my house which used to process the paddy harvest (in old way). We played there and sometimes managed to hit the ball straight to the roof of my house which is made from metalic sheets and made a loud noise and source for complaints from my parents. But the complaints weren't enough to stop the play. I think this too was stopped when we gradually got older and somewhere when I was in around 13-14 years old.</p>
<p>Video Games
My father brought a computer home when I was around 15 years old I think. This computer had 40GB ram and 128 Ram, I forgot what's the processor. This opens up the possibility of playing video games. I remember playing Need for speed series, Duke Nukem and Grand theft auto.</p>
<p>Watching Movies
This is another hobby made possible with the Computer. I remember taking the hard drive off of the computer and carrying it to friends place to collect there movies to take home and watch.</p>
<p>Photography
This hobby started when I moved to Singapore. Not exactly sure what triggered this, but I bought the sony a6000 (after lot of research of course) in 2019. Then in 2022 I upgraded the camera to canon full frame R6. I even managed to win couple of prices for my photos. This still remains as one of my main hobby.</p>
<p>Running
I started running during the covid period. At the peak I ran a Full marathon. But nowadays I don't run much mainly because of the overplaying the beach sports.</p>
<p>Beach Tennis
This is another top of the list hobby for me. I started somewhere in 2022 and being playing since.</p>
<p>Dancing.
I tried dancing for 6 months in 2024. The genre I tried was bachata. But I had a hard time picking up the beat of the song. So it wasn't a much enjoyble experience for me. And I believe I've higher than normal self conciese level, which made this worse. But I might give this another attemp sometime.</p>
<p>Beach Volleyball
This is my newest hobby. This was started in this year May, and I've playing consistently.</p>

<p class="meta">Published on 2022-05-23</p>
<p>Over the past 2-3 years I've being working out consistently.
Outside.
Running and body-weights.
I worked out 4-5 days per week.
Alternating between running and body-weights.</p>
<p>But after the moving, my workout process was disrupted.
Because I couldn't find a place near new place to do them.
There is a PCN nearby.
But on one side it has a bridge, and other side a road crossing.
Not so ideal for running.
And I couldn't find any suitable park to do the body-weights in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>So I decided to go the office gym.
Up to this point I always tried to avoid going to Gym.
Because I wanted to not to tied to gym for working out.</p>
<p>But then again why should I tied to doing body-weights.</p>
<p>So I booked the Gym for 5 days (starting May 16).
First week was just exploring the machines and building a habit.
Running on treadmill felt quite different to outdoor running.
And I was afraid to let go of the rail.
So I just walked on the treadmill.
First holding to the rail.
Then without.
By the end of week I was able to run about 1k without holding to the rail.
I also tried few body-weights(pull ups and rows).
That's for the first week.</p>
<p>Now I'm in the middle of the 2nd week.
I did 5k treadmill run on Monday.
And tried the beginners routing on reddit/fitness wiki on Tuesday.
I tried the Set A which include, barbel rows, bench-press and Squats with just the barbell bar(20kg)
It felt good and I feel body is responding to the exercises.
Today is Wednesday and I'm Planing to do another 5k Run today.
Plan is to alternate weights and cardio.
Tomorrow I'll try the set B,
which includes dead-lift, chin-ups and overhead-press.</p>

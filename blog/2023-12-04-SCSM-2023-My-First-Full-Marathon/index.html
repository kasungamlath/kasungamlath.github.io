After finishing 3 half-marathons over past few years, yesterday I did my first full marathon.
And it took 6 hours and 22 minutes for me to finish.

I finished the first half in 2:30.
But after that my legs started complaining.
So had to walk for the most of the second part.
I was afraid, else I won't be able to finish the race.

It was a great experience.
Felt like I have grown into big boy pants running a full-marathon after 3 half-marathons.
But last year half-marathon was more fun (except for the raining at the beginning).
Mostly because it's my first in-person half-marathon, and I did run all the way.
I find running is far more enjoyable than walking in a race.

Full distribution of completion time for all the finishers.
Highlighted is my time.

And few more bonus plots on SCSM 2023.

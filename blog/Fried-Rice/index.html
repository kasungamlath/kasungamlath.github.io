<p>Today I made fried rice from left over rice and chicken.
The taste of this varient is more similar to fried rice found in small shops.</p>
<p>The final result look like this,</p>

<p>Ingredients :</p>
<ul>
<li>Left over rice collected over about a week and stored in fridge,
(storing in the fridge adds a nice texture to the rice)</li>
<li>2 Carrots - cut in to thin pieces.</li>
<li>3 Leaks - cut in to small pieces.(doesn't add much taste, but looks great)</li>
<li>3 Red onions - cut in to small pieces.</li>
<li>3 garlic pieces - same as red onions but smaller.</li>
<li>small piece of ginger - chopped in to small pieces.</li>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>left over bite chicken - microwave and peel in to thin pieces.</li>
<li>piece of butter.</li>
<li>Salt and pepper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once ingredients are prepared,
Heat the wok.</li>
<li>Add butter and let it melt.</li>
<li>Add garlic.</li>
<li>Heat until garlic become kind of golden brown.</li>
<li>Add red onion.</li>
<li>When onions changed the color to golden brown add carrot.</li>
<li>Add salt and pepper to the taste.</li>
<li>Heat until carrot is half cooked.</li>
<li>Make space in the middle of the wok and put the contents of eggs there.</li>
<li>Mix the stuff in the wok well.</li>
<li>Heat it until the eggs become tiny solid pieces.</li>
<li>Add chicken pieces and leaks to the mix at this point.</li>
<li>Mix it well.</li>

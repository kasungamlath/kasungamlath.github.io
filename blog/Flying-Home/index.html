<p>I never liked flying.
I hate the waiting until the flight.
Flying itself is not so bad.
Once I get in to the plane, It's all good.
I just don't like the waiting.</p>
<p>This is the second time this year I'm flying.
First time was more interesting.
First time this year was the first time I flew since covid.
After about a 2 years wait.</p>
<p>I think it gets little better each time.
Meaning if I fly more frequently I'll feel better.
But the issue is I'm also not very keen on flying.</p>
<p>Travel by train - well that's a way of traveling I like.
Issue with flying is, there's nothing to the journey.
There's no scenery.
You hop on a plane and try to kill the time until you get off.
And the hassle of checking in and out.</p>
<p>Granted - It's (unfortunately) the fastest way to travel.</p>

<p>On the last Christmas day I built a PC.
Building a powerful PC was a childhood dream of mine,
since I started playing PC games.</p>
<p>So on the Christmas day(2021) I came to office.
Plan was to buy the parts and build on my own.
The parts shop was near to the office.
So It's easier to bring the parts to office, build and transfer the whole unit to home.</p>
<p>I went to shop and bought,</p>
<ul>
<li>Gigabyte B550i AOURUS PRO AX AM4 ITX Motherboard</li>
<li>AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3.8Ghz</li>
<li>Crucial ballistix Gaming 3600MHz 32GB(16GBx2) CL 16</li>
<li>WD Black sn 750 SE 1TB GEN4 M.2 NVMe SSD</li>
<li>ASUS GT 1030 2GB</li>
<li>Cooler master masterbox NR200P Max casing with 850W gold PSU and 280MM IO</li>
</ul>
<p>Total price was 1900 SGD.
I wanted to buy a RTX3080.
But the prices are 2000+ SGD for MSRP 1100 SGD card.
So Decided to wait until price come down.</p>
<p>I bought the parts to office.
Unpacked and started putting them together.
Installing the cooler into cpu was the most difficult.</p>
<p>After about 2 hours all the parts are put together.
I booted the system.
It didn't start up. :(</p>
<p>I re-install the power cables.
Still no luck.
Ever power unit fan is not working.
I unplugged all the power cables.
Short the power unit.
No sign of working.</p>
<p>Time was close to 8pm now.
I packed the PC and dragged it to the parts shop.
Guy in the shop said they are planning to close down shop and leave the PC there.</p>
<p>But I insisted.
I wanted it to be done with.
So finally they offered help.</p>
<p>He started pulling the cables and putting them back.
And started the PC.
It booted!!! :D
I thanked him whole heartedly and bought the PC back to office, and then home.</p>
<p>Since then I've installed Windows 10 and few games on it.
But the GPU is quite a bottle neck.
It's not possible the play recent AAA games due to GPU limitation.
But it can comfortable play old titles like</p>
<ul>
<li>GTA 5</li>
<li>NFS Most wanted</li>
</ul>
<p>Which will do until GPU prices come down(hopefully)</p>

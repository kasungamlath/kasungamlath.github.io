<h1><a href="/blog/End-of-Term-One/">End of Term One</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2023-11-23</p>
<p>This week is the 1st (out of 2) exam week for the term 1 of my masters (and my Instructor career) at SMU.
I only read one course for the master, and it didn’t have final exam.
So 1st term of my masters is officially done.
For the Instructing, I still have to invigilate two exams.
After that instructor work for 1st term is done.
Then I get to prep for the term two.</p>
<p>All in all term one was great.
Getting used to studying and teaching at the same time was novel to say the least.</p>
<p>Teaching is fun.
Hardest thing I found about the teaching is keeping the students’ attention throughout the class.
If the lesson is too easy I loose the half of the class.
If too challenging I loose other half of the class.
Finding the balance is a trick.
And each section (set of students) is different.
So need to be able to read the class well, in order to be a good instructor.</p>
<p>Reading for the masters was also a pleasant experience.
Except for the lecture timing.
It’s very hard to focus during 7pm-10pm, specially given I started the day at 6am.
But the personal interest I had for the course I took (Deep Learning and Computer vision was interesting) made it bearable.
I finally get to learn the theory behind some of the stuff I worked on for past couple of years.</p>

<p class="meta">Published on 2023-02-19</p>
<p>January was all rain.
That means no cycling, no Tennis, only an occasional run.</p>
<p>Office work is also in a challenging mode.
Because, for the Neuromorphic project we recently started, I needed to learn low level details on deep learning.</p>
<p>But my gym frequency is good so far.
I've made a New-Year resolution to go to gym at 9am, 4 days per week.
After a rough start, that habit is settiling in now.
Last week I started doing Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 BB program properly.</p>
<p>I did,</p>
<ul>
<li>bench press - 30 x 5, 35 x 5, 40 x 5, 30 x 10 x 5</li>
<li>back squat - 45 x 5, 50 x 5, 55 x 5, 40 x 10 x 5</li>
<li>dead lift - 60 x 5, 70 x 5, 85 x 5, 50 x 10 x 5</li>
<li>overhead press - 20 x 5, 25 x 5, 30 x 5, 20 x 10 x 5</li>
</ul>
<p>For whatever reason squats hit me the hardest and I had trouble climbing stairs even after 2 days of work out.</p>
<p>There were 2 BBQ nights back to back on last 2 saturdays.
Come to think of it, one in East (of singapore) and other in West.</p>
<p>I also did my friend's post-wedding shoot last week.
Photos turned out to be quite OK considering I had to use the sony a6000 with kit lens.</p>

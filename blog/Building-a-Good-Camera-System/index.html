<p>I bought my sony alpha a6000 camera with 16-50mm kit lens 3+ years ago.
Later I added 55-210mm kit lens.
Then 35mm f/1.8 prime.
And I was using the camera at least once per week.</p>
<p>Recently I started to feel like I've grown out of my lens setup.
Now I'm sure I want to make photography a serious hobby.
So started thinking about a lens upgrade.</p>
<p>My initial plan was to replace the two kit lenses with high-ends.
But it occured to me that, not so far down the road the cropped sensor might become the limiting factor.
And I'll end up with needing to replace whole setup for a full frame system.
So why not start building the full frame system now ?</p>
<p>Granted the initial expense is high.
But assuming a pro lenses can easily last 10+ years and don't loose much value with time,
In the long run it's a OK expense.
If I shoot once a week initial expense will be devided by 10x52 = 520 per one shooting session.
Assuming 10k initial expense, per session becomes ~20 SGD.</p>
<p>After making sure the math is correct,
I started researching on Full Frame cameras.
And it seems (at the moment) Cannon make the best full frame mirrorless lenses.
Though collection of lenses is limted compared to Sony available lenses were better.</p>
<p>So I bought the Canon R6 (680g with battery + SD card) with 70-200mm f/2.8 (1200g with tripod mount).
lens really fast, sharp and whole setup (at 1880g) is quite OK to carry.</p>

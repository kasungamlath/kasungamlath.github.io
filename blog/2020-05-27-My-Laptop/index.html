My personal laptop is a [Thinkpad x220](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X_series#X220)
It was released on 2011 April with starting [price](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/lenovo-thinkpad-x220) of 
* i3 - 979 USD
* i5 - 1299 USD
* i7 - ???

I bought i7 unit second hand on 2018 for about 200SGD
This unit came with,
* IPS display.
* 4 gigs of memory.
* No hard disk.
* 6 cell battery with ~35% of design capacity.(which holds up like 2 hours of battery time)

I made following upgrades after buying it.
* 2x8GB memory (bought for 60SGD second hand).
* Original Lenovo 9 cell battery (bought brand new for ~80SGD).
* Samsung 860 EVO 250GB ssd disk (~80SGD).
* New thermal paste.

So the final specs of the laptop are
* Intel core i7 second gen processor
* 16 GB RAM
* 9 cell battery (about 10 hours of battery life)
* 250 SSD
* 12.5 IPS display

I'm running a arch linux installation with i3 window manager.
i3 fits perfectly for the 12.5 display.
It's very reliable. I've kept it on for months without any issues.
Main reason for this being the my main laptop (I have total of 3 working + 1 dead laptops) is the keyboard design.
It's such a pleasure to type on this.

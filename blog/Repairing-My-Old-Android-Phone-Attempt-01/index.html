<p class="meta">Published on 2020-06-04</p>
<p>It happened 2 weeks ago.
My phone died.
It was a Xiaomi mi A2.
It suddenly refused to charge.
<a href="https://kasungamlath.com/blog/Phone-Died/">here</a> is the full story.</p>
<p>Apart from the not charging issue (and cracked screen) phone was in good condition.
So I though about fixing it.
As I checked with multiple cables and charging sources(without any luck) I assumed issue is with the phone it self.
Could be either software issue or hardware issue.
But couldn't investigate further as phone is not starting anymore.</p>
<p>But just before dying phone was heating up abnormally while plugged in to rapid charge.
Attributing to this I assumed the most probable fault part is the battery.
So I ordered a Battery which cost ~30 SGD.
It arrived yesterday.</p>

<p>So I took the phone apart.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/phone_parts.jpg" alt="full-width" /></p>
<p>There was a issue when replacing the battery from phone due to glue.
But with some difficulty I managed to remove the battery.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/old_battery.jpg" alt="full-width" /></p>
<p>Installed the new battery and booted up the phone.
Thankfully phone booted up.</p>

<p>Battery had about ~50% of the charge out of the box.
But when plugged in to the charger it still refused to charge.</p>
<p>Well that's life for you.</p>
<p>So to check if it's a software issue I did a hard reset.
Still not charging.</p>
<p>But I noticed a interesting fact.
When plugged in to the PC, only when you rammed the cable up the port it detects the connection.
And it does that with a only one specific cable too.
But unfortunately that connection also keep loosing and reconnecting.</p>
<p>So as per evidence it's a faulty usb port.
I ordered one today for ~10 SGD.
It should arrive within 2 weeks.</p>

<p class="meta">Published on 2024-08-14</p>
<p>This week is the last of my first academic year (for my masters program), and my new career as an instructor.</p>
<p>Looking back it's exciting and rewarding year.
I completed 2 out of 6 courses required for the masters program.
And supported 3 different courses as an instructor.</p>
<p>Sitting in a class felt (for the lack of better word) &quot;weird&quot; at the beginning, on both sides.
It's 8+ years since I last sat in a class as a student and first time being an instructor.
During the first term I supported one course and took one course for the masters.</p>
<p>Second term was merely a continuation of the first, with slightly higher work load.
Work load was higher because I was supporting 2 subjects, compared to 1 in first.
And was learning a subject (information security) I'm not familiar with.</p>
<p>After the second term came the third which is the summer term/break.
Since my school doesn't offer any courses during the summer term I didn't have to actively support a course nor learn.
Given these two activities occupied the majority of my time during first two terms, I ended up with a lot of free time on my hand.
During this time I mainly did prepare for the course I'm about to support, and read about the course I planned to learn.</p>
<p>During summer term/break, I also played a bit of racket sports (mainly table tennis due to my recovering tennis elbow), <a href="/blog/Home-Trip/">traveled home</a>, <a href="/blog/Walk-in-the-Park(s)/">walked across Singapore</a>, <a href="/blog/Kota-Bharu/">took a train to the boarder of Thailand via Malaysia</a>, and <a href="/photos/">took lots of photos</a>.</p>
<p>And from what I have seen so far, I expect the coming year to be more or less a repetition of the last.</p>

<p class="meta">Published on 2024-08-14</p>
This week is the last of my first academic year (for my masters program), and my new career as an instructor.

Looking back it's exciting and rewarding year.
I completed 2 out of 6 courses required for the masters program.
And supported 3 different courses as an instructor.

Sitting in a class felt (for the lack of better word) "weird" at the beginning, on both sides.
It's 8+ years since I last sat in a class as a student and first time being an instructor.
During the first term I supported one course and took one course for the masters.

Second term was merely a continuation of the first, with slightly higher work load.
Work load was higher because I was supporting 2 subjects, compared to 1 in first.
And was learning a subject (information security) I'm not familiar with.

After the second term came the third which is the summer term/break.
Since my school doesn't offer any courses during the summer term I didn't have to actively support a course nor learn.
Given these two activities occupied the majority of my time during first two terms, I ended up with a lot of free time on my hand.
During this time I mainly did prepare for the course I'm about to support, and read about the course I planned to learn.

During summer term/break, I also played a bit of racket sports (mainly table tennis due to my recovering tennis elbow), [traveled home](/blog/Home-Trip/), [walked across Singapore](/blog/Walk-in-the-Park(s)/), [took a train to the boarder of Thailand via Malaysia](/blog/Kota-Bharu/), and [took lots of photos](/photos/).

And from what I have seen so far, I expect the coming year to be more or less a repetition of the last.

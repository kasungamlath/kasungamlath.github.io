Last term my choice of subject (for the master's degree) was Learning and Planning in Intelligent Systems.
We were offered 3 choices, and I already have completed one of them.
So it's a choice between Machine Learning or this.

With my work schedule this module was the preferred choice.
But into few weeks, I noticed that I don't understand what's going on in the classroom.
The course is on Reinforcement Learning, and I was completely new to the subject.
The content is heavy on math which wasn't my forte.

Then came the first quiz which weighted 12.5% of the final grade.
And I only got 38%.

This made me realize I needed to make serious effort if I'm to successfully finish the module.
After that I spent few hours per week going through the slides, re-watching the lecture video and consulting ChatGPT/ Gemini to make these notes.
And these notes helped me quite a lot to understand the subject.
At the end I got a B for subject.
That means I got at least 74% of the final grade.

To me that was great progress from where I started.

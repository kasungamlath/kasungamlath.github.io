<h1><a href="/blog/End-of-Second-Term/">End of Second Term</a></h1>
<p class="meta">Published on 2024-04-21</p>
<p>Past week was the first exam week (exams usually held over two weeks) for the second term of 23-24 academic year.
Exams for both of the courses I was supporting, and the course I was reading for the masters, held during last week.
So (except for few grading components) term is over for me.</p>
<p>Time to enjoy the summer break.</p>
<p>This second term felt harder than the first term.
May be because I was supporting two new courses.
Or because initial enthusiasm for the new job is over.
But I felt I did much better compared to the first term.
Both at supporting the courses and reading for the masters course.</p>
<p>For the record I was supporting CS205-Operating Systems with Android and IS113-Web Application development 1.
And I was reading the CS704-Information Systems.</p>

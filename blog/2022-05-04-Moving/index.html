<p>May 1st 2022 I moved to a new place.
I've being at my previous place for 2+ years.
It was a rented HDB flat at Houagang, with some of my friends.
During my stay rent was changed between 400 - 1100 SGD.
Depending on the number of tenants at the period and the house rent.
The last rent I paid was 2400SGD/5 = 480SGD</p>
<p>My new place is a common room at Condominium in Aljunied.
New place costs 1300SGD - 50 = 1250SGD.
So it's roughly 3x of the old price.</p>
<p>I managed to pack all my belongings to 1 checking luggage plus 2 hand luggages.
Except for the PC and 3 pair of shoes.
1 hand luggage is filled with almost useless stuff.
Should clear it sometime.</p>

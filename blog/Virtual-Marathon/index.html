<p>I was checking the mails on July 20 morning and saw an email about a virtual marathon.</p>
<p>How it happens is, within 25 days (20July - 15 Aug) finish either of the bellow distances.</p>
<ul>
<li>5 km</li>
<li>10 km</li>
<li>20.1 km</li>
<li>42.2 km</li>
<li>78.3 km</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't even has to be a continuous run.</p>
<p>As a proof it's required to upload a screenshot of the run recorded by approved mobile app.</p>
<p>As I have already being running about 20km per week I chose to run 78.3 km.
Fees for the participation in 78.3 km distance was 30 SGD.</p>
<p>I registered for the event.
Then started running and submitting the screenshots.</p>
<p>Today I got a email saying that I have completed the distance.</p>
<p>So there's another first in my life, running a virtual marathon.</p>

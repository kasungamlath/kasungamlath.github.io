<p class="meta">Published on 2023-12-19</p>
<p>Last weekend I went to Malaysia for a 2 day trip.
This marks the third country I've being to, so far.
I visited Johor Bahru (JB).
JB happends to be a popular weekend-gateway for people in Singapore.
It's the closest to singapore (and can be visited by land)</p>
<p>I took a bus to JB.
The bus is operated by SMRT and starts from woodlands terminal.
Bus goes straight to the woodlands checkpoint.
Alighted at the checkpoint and went through the emigration process from singapore.
After that took another bus to the JB checkpoint.
At JB checkpoint alighted again and went through the Malaysian immigration.
Then took a cab to Pelangi Plaza to have lunch.</p>

<p>Pelangi Plaza shopping mall looks desserted except for only a few visitors.
Food prices were quit cheaper compared to Singapore.
While having the lunch booked a nearby hotel to stay.</p>
<p>After the lunch started walking to the hotel (following the postal code).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/jb_trip_2023/walking.jpeg" alt="full-width" /></p>
<p>Followed the postal code turned out to be a mistake.
Though in singapore the area covered by one postal code is very small,
Malaysia it's huge.
After about 2km walk stoped for a milkshake and check of the map.</p>

<p>Turnes out hotel is already passed while walking.</p>
<p>Discovering that, took a cab to the hotel (cab fares are also cheaper than singapore).
Then rested for a while and went to KSL mall for bit of a shopping and the dinner.</p>

<p>Follwing the dinner walked back to the hotel.</p>
<p>Following morning went to look for a place to have the breakfast.
And found a nice nearby place.</p>

<td width="33%"> <img src="/assets/jb_trip_2023/chicken.jpeg" alt="Drawing"/> </td>
</tr></table>
<p>The breakfast turned out to be quite nice.
After the breakfast came back to hotel, checked out and went to Holiday Plaza.
There did bit of more shopping and had another tea with fried banana.</p>

<p>After that went to Johor Bahru City Square which is next to the JB emigration.
Following bit of further shopping there, went through the emigration process and came back to Singapore.</p>

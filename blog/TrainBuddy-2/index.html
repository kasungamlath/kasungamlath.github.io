<p>After more than two years, today I released a new version of TrainBuddy (TrainBuddy acted as my ultimate portfolio app to land current job). New version contains lesser features (features that were broke for some time, but no one complained about. So I guess no one is using them anyway) Now its a full time train schedule app with a brand new API coming in near future. It also contains adds, which I hope will act as a motivating factor for me to tend the app in the future.</p>

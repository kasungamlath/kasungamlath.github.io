Last couple of months I was feeling pretty weak.
Then I lost about 2 kg of body weight (without trying !).
I attribute this to my diet.
I had increased amount of physical activity (I was training for a marathon), but my diet was not up to it.

And I was also concerned about the nutrition levels of the stuff I eat.
I was eating all three meals outside.
And none of them contained many vegetables.
But based on the health guidelines half of the plate should be filled from vegetables (and fruit).
And quarter from carbs and remaining from protein.

So yesterday I decided to make a change.
I started cooking again.
This is what I came up with.
It's chicken, eggs, broccoli and sweet potato.

(Broccoli in the picture is not cooked properly, had to cook them again).
I'm planing to find more recipes and cook more and more.

<p class="meta">Published on 2023-08-24</p>
<p>This month I started reading for my masters.
My program requires me covering six courses (6 CU) plus one capstone project (4 CU) over the span of next 2-3 years.
I decided to take only one module for this term, because</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s being a long time I’ve being a student in a class room.</li>
<li>I just did a major career change (from engineer to teacher) and still getting used to the new role.</li>
<li>The other module I wanted to take is on Thursday (1900-2215) and I have to teach two sections on Thursday (0800-1100 &amp; 1200-1500). On top of that I’ll be teaching another section on Friday morning at 0800.</li>
</ol>
<p>The course I’m taking is CS701 - computer vision and deep learning, which I already have some practical experience.</p>
<p>The worst thing about the lecture is timing.<br />
1900-2215 is definitely not a good time to be sitting in a lecture.
But it cannot be helped.</p>
<p>All in all it’s fun to be back in school.</p>

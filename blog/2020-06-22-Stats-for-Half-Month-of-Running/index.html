<p class="meta">Published on 2020-06-22</p>
I started recording my runs on a app called strava in June 5th.
Today is June 22nd,
So I have data for 16 days(until yesterday) of running.
Half a month of data.
So I decided to see how I have being doing.

But before that a bit about my run recording mechanism.
I am learning to run using a book written by a [Jack Daniels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Daniels_(coach)).
It has workouts on different paces per session.
And I record them different paces as different runs.
(To see the pace difference)

Bellow are the numbers as of now.

* 400m best :1.52(4.40/km)
* 1/2 mile best :4.35(5.42/km)
* 1k best :5.45
* 1mile best :10.09(6.18/km)
* 2mile best :21.33(6.42/km)
* longest run :5.54km(7.15/km)
* total distance :60km
* total time :7.11

And this is the route (which roughly translates to 1.1km).

I also want to note that I'm not deliberately trying to set the records (yet).
Still only trying to follow the plan in the book.
So above numbers are not an end itself but a mean to an end.

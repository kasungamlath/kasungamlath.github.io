<p>Cohen(old legendary barbarian hero) with his silver horde is going to meet the gods and return what first hero stole(fire).</p>
<p>And state his dislike on heroes dying from natural causes.</p>
<p>Then may be blow up where the gods live.</p>
<p>But if they are successful the world will end.</p>
<p>So Rincewind(best unsuccessful wizard, accidental savior of world(multiple times), but most of all a coward),
watchman Carrot(6 foot tall honest dwarf policeman) and Leonard of Quirm(absent minded genius) are going to stop them on orders from Lord Vetinari(patricain/dictator of the city state Ankh-Mprpork).</p>
<p><em>“Lots of people would be as cowardly as me if they were brave enough.”</em> - RinceWind</p>

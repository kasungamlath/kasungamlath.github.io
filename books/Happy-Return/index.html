<p>After reading most of the books in Terry Prachet's Disc world series,
I started reading a new series.
It's written by C.S. Foster and about a sea man named Horatio Hornblower</p>
<p>After reading the Disc world series in chronological order,
I decided to read this in the order author written it.
I feel it helps in getting the little details and necessary character introductions.</p>
<p>This story happens in real world (unlike disc world series).</p>
<p>This book introduces us to Horatio Hornblower and his crew.
Horatio is the captain of a English navy ship named Lydia.
This is the time when Britain rule the sea.
They fight other nations to retain that power.</p>
<p>Horatio first tasked with helping a insane Spanish land owner to rebel against the Spanish government.
Goal is to weaken the Spanish power.
But then politics change and Spain become ally of Britain.
Now he finds himself with orders to help the Spanish government and fight the Spanish rebel he first helped with.
Which he does successfully and also gives passage to a lady in a powerful family (Lady Barbara)</p>
<p>Though he's a married man He fell in love with Lady Barbara and she with him.
But he fights his feelings and manged to stay faithful to his wife.</p>
<p>At the end the ship reaches England successfully and Lady Barbara leaves little crossed and heart broken and Horatio questioning his decisions.</p>
<p>Most interesting part of the book is to me is the narrative of the inner thoughts of the Horatio.
Though he's the captain of the ship and his crew respects him very much,
He doesn't keep himself in high standards.
He questions his decisions.
He's under confidant but he doesn't show that to outside.
He goes into deep struggle to hide his feelings.</p>

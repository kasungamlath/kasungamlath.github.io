# Garden

My name is Kasun. I'm a Sri Lankan, based in Singapore.

Since 2023 August I've been working as an instructor of Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) in SMU, and doing a (part-time) masters in computing.

I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2016. After graduating, I've worked as a Software Engineer and after that a Research Engineer.

While instructing and reading for the masters take most of my time,
I also do, 
* [Take photos](/photos)
* [Read books](/books.html)
* Play badminton, table tennis, and beach tennis. At the moment I'm the top (and only) ranking Beach Tennis player in Sri Lanka.
* Train and participate in (long distance) running events. (So far I've done 1 full marathon, and 2 half-marathons)

Following are my personal bests at running.
* Full marathon (2023) - 6:22:19
* Half marathon (2022) - 2:21:11
* 5k run (2021) - 28:23

1. The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness _by Jonathan Haidt_ (3.5/4)\
_First half is explaining, why the gen Z are the way they are (culprit is screen time and social media). Second part is on preventive measures. Target audience is mainly the parents of young children. It would've being nicer if it's written to more general audience._

1. Dead Lions _by Mick Herron_ (4/5)\
_Great sequel for the first book of the series._
1. Slow Horses _by Mick Herron_ (4/5)\
_Read after watching the TV series. Slight differences in comparison. I'd prefer the book version than the TV version._
1. Think Faster, Talk Smarter: How to Speak Successfully When You're Put on the Spot _by Matt Abrahams_ (3/5)\
_Two parts of the book. First explains the theory and second gives practical advice on specific scenarios. Read the first part and skimmed the second._
1. The Road to Character _by David Brooks_ (3.5/5)\
_Enjoyed the first part of the book. Carries a strong punch and engaging. But the last few chapters are weak. Feels like the author ran out of good stuff and is fishing. The conclusion is also not very convincing._

2024

1. Diary of a Wimpy Kid (#1-15) _by Jeff Kinney_ (4/5)\
_First few books are great. Rest are OK. Wish I found these when I am a kid._
1. The Unexpected Joy of the Ordinary _by Catherine Gray_ (3/5)\
_I saw a person reading this book on train. And found good reviews online. The book was available in the library@harbourfront. So I went there just to collect this book. Though it's an easy read it's not as enlightening as I expected._
1. The Day of the Jackal _by Frederick Forsyth_ (4/5)\
_Great flow of and twists enough to keep the reader guessing, though it's said the assassination attempt fails at the beginning of the story. Much better than the first few episodes of the TV series. Haven't watched the movie yet EDIT: Book is much better than movie_
1. Brave New World _by Aldous Huxley_ (4/5)
1. Project Hail Mary _by Andy Weir_ (2/5)\
_Science stuff and talking to self gets boring after a while. Skimmed through after the first half of the book. Tries a bit too hard to be funny. All the characters are altruistic (even the alien). Only bad guys in the book are single cell creatures._

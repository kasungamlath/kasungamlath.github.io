Friend invited me to shoot a cricket match.
Saturday early morning with a rainy yesterday.
Ground was bit muddy.

And sun comes from the right side of the pitch.
So early shots are from right side of the ground directly in line with the batsman.
Later took some shots from behind the batsman to capture expressions of the bowlers.
Then towards the end, from behind the bowlers.

The conclusion is 70-200mm lens is not the optimal and moving around the ground is not ideal.
Much better scenario would be 4 200mm+ lenses on left, right, behind and front of the pitch.
Then it would be possible to cover most of the shots.

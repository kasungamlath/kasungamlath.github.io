<p class="meta">Published on 2024-06-17</p>
Today morning I went to a canine photography session organised by safra content creators club.
It was held in an open area. 
First such place I've seen. 
It's an open area near Alexandra Park.
~20 min walk from nearest bus stop though.

Unfortunately during the shoot, light was too harsh.
Sun was high and no clouds in the sky.
That made the colors dull in photos.

But today I got convinced dogs can actually smile !!

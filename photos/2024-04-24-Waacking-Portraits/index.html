Capturing a dance in a single frame is impossible.
But it should be possible to capture at least a part of the dance, may be a movement and the dancer's emotion?
Following are the results of my attempt on this.

The event is a Waacking (a dance) competition in Singapore.
Competition organizer was kind enough to invite me as a photographer.

I used a slow shutter speed to capture the movement and did a close crop to isolate the dancer's face.
Then converted the photos to monochrome to draw the attention to the emotions and movement.

The most challenging part of this is, capturing the movement and get an eye-pleasing image.
To do that some part of the image (ideally the face/eyes) need to be sharp while other parts are blurred.
